1Ô∏è‚É£ **DevOps Fundamentals**

Mastering the **foundations of DevOps** is crucial before diving into advanced topics.

üîπ **Key Topics:**

‚Ä¢	**Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** ‚Äì Understand stages like **planning, development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.**

**‚Ä¢	Linux Basics & Shell Scripting:**

o	File system management: ls, cd, mkdir, rm, find, grep

o	Process monitoring: top, htop, ps, kill

o	Writing basic **Bash scripts** for automation.

**‚Ä¢	Version Control (Git & GitHub/GitLab):**

o	Key commands: git init, clone, branch, merge, pull, push

o	Best practices for **collaboration and code management.**

**‚Ä¢	Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**

o	Understand **CI/CD pipeline stages**: build, test, deploy.

o	Use **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD** for automation.

**‚Ä¢	Containerization (Docker & Kubernetes):**

o	**Docker:** Writing optimized Dockerfiles, managing images, volumes, and networks.

o	**Kubernetes:** Deploying microservices, scaling applications, networking, Ingress controllers.

**‚Ä¢	Infrastructure Automation:**

o	**Ansible** for configuration management.

o	**Terraform** for infrastructure as code (detailed below).

‚úÖ **Real-World Example**

```sh
# Sample Bash script to automate server updates
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
echo "System updated successfully!"
```

---

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Cloud Computing (AWS & Azure)**

Cloud platforms **enable scalable, secure, and cost-effective application deployment.** The two most in-demand providers are **AWS and Azure**.

üîπ **Key Topics:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Cloud Basics**

‚Ä¢	Public vs. Private Cloud

‚Ä¢	Virtualization & containerization concepts

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**

‚Ä¢	User roles, policies, authentication, authorization.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Networking**

**‚Ä¢	VPC, Subnets, CIDR**

**‚Ä¢	Security Groups, Load Balancers**

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Compute Services**

‚Ä¢	**AWS EC2 / Azure VMs** ‚Äì Instance provisioning & scaling

‚Ä¢	Serverless computing: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Storage & Databases**

‚Ä¢	**AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage**

‚Ä¢	SQL & NoSQL database services

6Ô∏è‚É£ **CI/CD on Cloud**

‚Ä¢	AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps Pipelines

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Kubernetes on Cloud**

‚Ä¢	**AWS EKS / Azure AKS** ‚Äì Deploy scalable applications

‚úÖ **Real-World Example**

```sh
# Terraform script to create an AWS EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "my-key"
}
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** enables **automated provisioning and management** of cloud resources.

üîπ **Key Topics:**

**‚Ä¢	Terraform Basics:** init, plan, apply, destroy.

**‚Ä¢	State Management:** Handling state files effectively.

**‚Ä¢	Variables & Modules:** Writing reusable infrastructure code.

**‚Ä¢	Multi-Cloud Deployments:** Managing AWS, Azure, and GCP using Terraform.

---

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Python for DevOps**

Python is widely used in **automation, scripting, and API integrations.**

üîπ **Key Topics:**

**‚Ä¢	Basic Syntax & Data Types**

**‚Ä¢	Loops & Conditions**

**‚Ä¢	Working with APIs (requests module)**

**‚Ä¢	Automating Cloud & DevOps tasks** (AWS Boto3, GitHub API, Jenkins API).

‚úÖ **Real-World Example**

```sh
import requests
response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
print(response.json())
```

---

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Observability & Monitoring**

Monitoring is essential for **detecting failures and optimizing performance.**

üîπ **Key Topics:**

**‚Ä¢	Metrics & Monitoring:**

**o	Prometheus & Grafana** ‚Äì Collect and visualize system metrics.

**‚Ä¢	Logging & Tracing:**

**o	ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**

**o	Jaeger for distributed tracing**

**‚Ä¢	Cloud-based Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor

‚úÖ **Real-World Example**

```sh
# Prometheus scrape configuration for Kubernetes
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "kubernetes"
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
```

---

6Ô∏è‚É£ **AI-Powered DevOps (AIOps)**
